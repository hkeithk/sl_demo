This repo was created to demo frontend development skills for an ecommerce website. The requirements were to use a stubbed redux middleware that returned a JSON object and React to build the application. 

I used React class-based components, Redux and ChartJS for plotting the sales data. Also included a simple asc/desc sort functionality on the table. 

Overall a good learning experience as I've primarily used React Hooks instead of class-based components. Also a good intro to ChartJs and how I can plot data for the future. 

Will continue to improve on this and add more functionality to practice JS/React.
